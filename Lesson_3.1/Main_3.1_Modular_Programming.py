# Unit: Object Oriented Programming
# Code is split into different parts, which are combined for legible and efficient code.
# Can be used if there is a lot of functions of one page or multiple large and complicated functions. These create
# clutter. These are split into Python files and can be accessed. Module contains Python code, each individual file
# is a module. Importing tells the current Python file that you want to use another file's functions, etc.
